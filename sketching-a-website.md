      ## What & why

      When designing websites it’s extremely helpful to plan ahead so we have a direction *before* writing a line of code.

      Sketching the layout, determining the HTML semantics & drawing the grid will make coding more straight-forward and understandable.

      **Let’s get some practice planning websites by working backwards from an already complete design.**

      ## Grid hints

      - Keep it simple
      - Use `fr` units
      - Think in “areas”
      - Not everything has to be in the grid
      - More than 1 element can occupy the same area
