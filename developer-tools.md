goal:
  before: |
    Learn about using the browser developer tools to modify and inspect websites.

    *The developer tools are really helpful when making websites because we can see what code is being applied and test solutions live in the browser.*

    **The developer tools should almost always be open when working on websites.** Since I use two monitors the developer tools are always open on my laptop, my code and browser open on the large screen.
