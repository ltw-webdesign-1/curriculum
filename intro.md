      ## How to succeed in Web Dev

      *Coding is a different mindset—and will be difficult for most*

      - [ ] Attend every class & lab
      - [ ] Do all the work
      - [ ] Put in the effort
      - [ ] Watch the videos before class
      - [ ] Use the resources available: teachers, TAs, lab time
      - [ ] Always ask for help

  - content: |
      ## You will struggle & fail*

      *\*Fail in the make mistakes sense, not in the fail the course sense*

      - It’s okay to struggle
      - It’s to make mistakes & have to start over
      - It’s okay to need help

      **Some of the best learning comes from failure**
