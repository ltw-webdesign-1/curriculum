      ## Process

      1. Make the repository
      2. Clone to your computer
      3. Write code, test & make commits
      4. Sync to GitHub
      5. See live website

      ## Commit to save state

      - Commit when you’ve done something significant
        <br>*Add the navigation; Style the footer; Fix a bug*
      - Every commit needs a message describing what changed
      - **Commit often!**
      - It’s a habit you’ll have to form

      ## Commit message best practices

      1. Minimum 3 words & 10 characters
      2. Proper spelling & grammar
        <br>Capital starting letter, no period
      3. Must start with an imperative verb
        <br>*Create*, *Fix*, *Add*, *Solve*, etc.

      Pretend every commit starts with the phrase: **“This commit will…”**

      “Add the navigation”

      ## Fork + Markbot

      *For the automatic marking system*

      1. Fork my repository into your account
      2. Commit & sync
      3. Drop the folder into Markbot
      4. See your automated tests pass/fail
      5. When they pass, submit it for grades
