steps:
  - title: "Go to Issues on a repo"
    before: |
      First go to the GitHub repository you are having problems with and press “Issues”.

    notes:
      - label: "Issues tab missing"
        text: |
          Sometimes the Issues tab doesn’t show when you’ve forked a repository—if that’s the case we just need to turn the Issues tab back on.

          Go to the “Settings” tab, then scroll down. Under the “Features” heading there should be an “Issues” checkbox you can enable.

          [Watch this video for a quick walk through.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTULg-7xycs&list=PLWjCJDeWfDdfSZOQYvsy_jJiAvx4uaJLB&index=9)

      ![](fields.jpg)

      1. *In the title write a short description of the problem. Something like:*
        “Footer looks wonky”
        “Colour isn’t showing up”
        “Columns aren’t side-by-side”
      2. *In the description, write as much detail as you can think of.*
        Links to lines of code, images, and formatting can all be used. [Check out the videos & tutorials for more details](/topics/github-issues/).

  - title: "Tag your teacher"
    before: |
      Make sure to tag your in your issue body with `@` followed by their username.

      Find their GitHub username on the weekly dashboard pages:

      ![](find-username.jpg)

      **Without the tag, your teacher won’t get notified.**

      ![](tag.jpg)

  - title: "Submit and wait…"
    before: |
      Submit the issue with the big green button.

      ![](submit.jpg)

      *And that’s it!*

      I’ll get a notification of the issue and go and respond below in the comment section.

      We can have a discussion about the problem and try to figure it out.
