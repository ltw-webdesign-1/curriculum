  - title: "Opening projects"
    before: |
      The best way to open code in Atom is to drag a whole folder from finder right to the Atom icon in your dock.

      ![](drag-to-dock.jpg)

      **The best part about this is that all the files within the folder will then be listed on the right hand side for easy access.**

      ![](sidebar.jpg)

      ### Opening multiple projects

      Same idea applies here: drag the folder to the dock icon. This will open a completely new Atom window which is significantly help you keep all the code files organized.
    notes:
      - label: "Shortcut"
        text: "If you don’t have Atom in your dock, put it there right now—you’ll be needing it a lot."
      - label: "Shortcut"
        text: "Use ``⌘` `` to switch between multiple project windows in Atom."

  - title: "Previewing & opening files"
    before: |
      **Single clicking** on a file within the Atom sidebar will preview that document in the Atom window.

      *You can tell it’s being previewed because a tab doesn’t get created or the name on the tab doesn’t change.*

      **Double clicking** on a files will open that document into a new tab in Atom that you can then edit.

      ### Using only the keyboard

      Atom has a super useful keyboard shortcut: `⌘P`—it will pop open a little dialog listing all the files in the current project. Start typing to search through the files and hit enter when you’ve highlighted the one you want.

      ![](command-p.jpg)

      *Just start typing to select the file you want.*

      ![](command-p-fuzzy.jpg)

      *You don’t even have to type all the letters—it will “fuzzy match” the name and find the one that’s closest to what you want.*
    notes:
      - label: "Shortcut"
        text: "Pressing `⌘P`—then you can search through all the files and open one without taking your hands off the keyboard."

  - title: "Making a new file"
    before: |
      In Atom, since we installed a package, there’s a shortcut key that will make a new file and save it directly into the folder we have open.

      ![](advanced-open-file.jpg)

      1. Press `⌘⌥O` to trigger a new dialog.
      2. Type the name of the file, including the extension.
      3. Hit `Return`—the file is saved into the folder you opened.

  - title: "Navigating between tabs"
    before: |
      Using a mouse is slow and cumbersome—that’s why keyboard shortcuts are amazing.

      ![](tab-numbers.gif)

      To navigate between tabs you can use the `⌘` key and numbers:
    shortcuts:
      - keys: "`⌘1`"
        text: "Will go to the first tab."
      - keys: "`⌘2`"
        text: "Will go to the second tab."
      - keys: "`⌘3`"
        text: "Will go to the third tab."
      - keys: "*etc.*"
        text: ""
    after: |
      Or you can use `⌘⇧[` and `⌘⇧]` to go backwards and forwards through the tabs.

  - title: "Navigating code"
    before: |
      Navigating code in Atom is the same as any text field in MacOS—all the same shortcuts apply.

      *It’s a really good idea to get a handle on these shortcuts because they will greatly increase your efficiency.*
    shortcuts:
      - keys: "`⌘C`"
        text: "Copy the selected text."
      - keys: "`⌘X`"
        text: "Cut the selected text."
      - keys: "`⌘V`"
        text: "Paste the previously copied item."
      - keys: "`⌘Z`"
        text: "Undo the recent change."
      - keys: "`⌘⇧Z`"
        text: "Redo the recent undo."
      - keys: "`⌘F`"
        text: "Find within this file."
      - keys: "`⌘G`"
        text: "Find next matching item."
      - keys: "`⌘⇧G`"
        text: "Find previous matching item."
      - keys: "`⌘➔`"
        text: "Move to the end of the line."
      - keys: "`⌘←`"
        text: "Move to the start of the line."
      - keys: "`⌥➔`"
        text: "Move to the next word."
      - keys: "`⌥←`"
        text: "Move to the previous word."
      - keys: "`⌘↑`"
        text: "Move to the top of the file."
      - keys: "`⌘↓`"
        text: "Move to the bottom of the file."
      - keys: "`Shift Arrows`"
        text: |
          - Highlight text.
          - Can be combined with `⌘` & `⌥`

      ### Manipulating multiple lines of code

      ![](multi-line.gif)

      By pressing the `⌘` key and clicking on multiple lines you can change code on many lines at once.

      **The great thing is that all the keyboard shortcuts you use for one line will now apply to all of those lines too!**

  - title: "Other important keyboard shortcuts"
    before: |
      Here are a few other important keyboard shortcuts you should remember to help you get more efficient:
    shortcuts:

        text: "Open the command palette to search everything the code editor can do."
      - keys: "`⌘/`"
        text: "Toggle comments on/off for code, knowing the correct language."
      - keys: "`⌘]`, `Tab`"
        text: "Indent a line of code or multiple lines of code."
      - keys: "`⌘[`, `Shift Tab`"
        text: "Outdent a line of code or multiple lines of code."
      - keys: "`⌘⌥F`"
        text: "Find and replace within this file."
      - keys: "`⌘⇧F`"
        text: "Find and replace within this folder."
      - keys: "`⌘R`"
        text: "Filter & find by keyword in this file."
      - keys: "`⌃⌘↑`"
        text: "Move a line up."
      - keys: "`⌃⌘↓`"
        text: "Move a line down."
      - keys: "`⌘J`"

      - keys: "`⌃⇧K`"
        text: "Delete this line."
