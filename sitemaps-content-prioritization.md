      **Sitemaps & content prioritization**

      ## Content first

      - Content is a priority for websites
        <br>—*people come for the content*
      - Content should be considered very early
      - Organization of content is important

      ## Page-to-page structure

      *Understanding a user’s flow helps structure pages*

      - Where does a user want to go?
      - What task does a user want to complete?
      - How do they get from one place to another?

      ## Sitemap diagram

      A sitemap diagram helps us understand how pages are connected together—visually.

    notes: |
      For small, simple websites, sitemaps can be very sparse.

      For this sitemap we can see that all the primary pages are connected together, but you have to enter into the “Services” section for more details of each offered service.

    alt: "An example of a sitemap for a more complex website, showing: multiple levels of navigation, repeated content types, and cross linking"
    notes: |
      For more complex websites we need to get a little more creative:

      - Show multiple levels of navigation & heirarchies
      - Show where content types repeat so we don’t have to diagram everything
      - Show how there is interlinking, where possible
    caption: "Complex sitemap with repeating content & lots of pages."

      ## Content prioritization

      *Help structure the content for importance to user*

      - Organize content by importance
      - Important content is highlighted, or more highly numbered
      - Audit content for relevance & helpfulness

  - type: figure

    alt: "An example of a content prioritization diagram—highlight things that are really import and some that aren’t."
    notes: |
      Using different shades of grey & black as backgrouns help prioritize page content.

      - black — the most important
      - grey — darker = more important, lighter = less important
      - white — the least important
    caption: "Darker grey is more important. You could use numbers too."
