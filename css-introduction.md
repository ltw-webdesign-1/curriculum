      ## CSS — the look

      *The chocolate to our peanut*

      The only thing CSS knows how to do is make something look a certain way

      It doesn’t understand content—only style

      ## In a separate file — `main.css`

      ![The folder structure we’re following, a folder named “css” with a file named “main.css” inside.](folder-structure.jpg)
    notes: |
      You can name the CSS file whatever you want, but for this courses we’re going to standardize on `main.css` to make everything consistent for everybody.

      Also, it doesn’t have to be in a `css` folder to work, but it’s a good for organization and consistency.

      **Follow the naming conventions!**

    notes: |
      - **Rule set:** The whole chunk of CSS that changes how elements look.
      - **Selector:** The piece of code that tells the CSS which HTML element should be targeted.
      - **Declaration:** A fancy name for a line of CSS that changes the look of an element.
      - **Property:** A defined set of attributes about the look of HTML that can be changed.
      - **Value:** What that attribute’s style will be changed to.

      CSS works by targeting something in the HTML the changing is visual design properties.
    html: |
      <h1>Brontosaurus</h1>
      <p class="intro">The “Thunder Lizard” with a long neck and long tail.</p>
      <p>Not a <b>dinosaur</b> for a long time, but now, again, real.</p>
    css_lines:
      - num: 1
        text: "The selector, `html`, what element we want to change. The `html` element surrounds the whole page so it’s a good thing to target to change the background colour of the whole website."
      - num: 2
        text: "The `background-color` property changes the color *behind* the text. Make sure to spell “color” the American way."
      - num: 7
        text: "The `font-weight` property controls whether something is bold or not; setting `font-weight` to normal makes the text not bold."
      - num: 9
        text: "Selecting with a tag, like `p` will change every single `<p>` element. If we want to style some elements differently from others we can give them names, called classes. This selector will target only the elements that are named `.intro`"

      There are many different ways to specify colours in CSS, here are a few popular ones.
    html: |
      <h1>Brontosaurus</h1>
      <p class="intro">The “Thunder Lizard” with a long neck and long tail.</p>
      <p>Not a <b>dinosaur</b> for a long time, but now, again, real.</p>
    css_lines:
      - num: 2
        text: "There are ~256 color keywords built into CSS, I generally only use these for testing purposes and stick to the basics like `red`, `green`, `blue`, etc. I have never used `cornsilk` and probably never will."
      - num: 5
        text: |
          Probably the most common way to specify colours is using hex values; hex colours always start with a `#`. It’s a number made of 3 pieces (red, green & blue). It don’t pretend to know these numbers, I just copy and paste them from Photoshop, but I can guess at how light or dark the colour is based on the value.

          They’re called “hex” numbers because they are “hexadecimal” meaning not based on 10 digits, but 16 digits.

          To count hex you start at 0 and go to 9, then start at A and go to F:

          ```
          0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f
          ```
      - num: 8
        text: "If we want semi-transparent colours, the best way is to use `rgba`. The last number is the opacity of the color, a decimal between 0 and 1, so `.5` is 50% transparent; the lower the number the more transparent."
      - num: 9
        text: |
          If the hex colour is made of duplicated letters in 3 pairs, it can be shortened to use only one of each duplicate.

          - `#fff` expands to `#ffffff`
          - `#f00` -> `#ff0000`
          - `#f39` -> `#ff3399`
    css: |
      html {
        background-color: cornsilk;
      }
      b {
        color: #22bb22;
      }
      .intro {
        background-color: rgba(85, 107, 47, .4);
        color: #fff;
      }
    css_hidden: |
      html {
        font-size: 2.5rem;
        font-family: Georgia, serif;
      }

    notes: |
      Browser’s have a few different layout width calculation models. The default is called `content-box` and the one we’re **always** going to use is called `border-box`. When making responsive websites `border-box` simplifies the math.

      With the default `content-box` if we specify a `width` the actual layout width is not what we specify but the sum of the `width` + `padding` + `border` so our layouts become cumbersome because we always have to make mathematical choices.

      With `border-box` the `width` we define is the final `width`: `border` and `padding` are inside what we define, making the math inconsequential.

    css: |
      /*
        Reset the layout math:
        - the padding is inside the width
        - friendlier for flexible layouts

        Put this at the top of EVERY CSS file
      */

      html {
        box-sizing: border-box;
      }

      *, *::before, *::after {
        box-sizing: inherit;
      }
